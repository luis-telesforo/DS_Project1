# Project 1: Is there a wage gap in Mexico?
* In this project we take two datasets from [INEGI](https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/programas/enoe/15ymas/datosabiertos/2022/conjunto_de_datos_enoen_2022_1t_csv.zip) to chek whether there is a gap wage in Mexico.
*First compare the mean of wages.
*We compare for position: total income and total income per hour. We calculate confidence intervals for the mean of the total income per hour.
*We compare for sector job: total income per hour. We calculate confidence intervals for the mean of the total income per hour
*From our analysis we cannot conclude anything about the wage gap in Mexico. The problem we found is the lack of data, there are many samples with no enough information.
